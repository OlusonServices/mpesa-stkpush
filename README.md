# mpesa-stkpush
This is a new functionality that simplifies registered customers’ payment journey for utility bills, goods, and services using M-Pesa. In addition, a merchant can request cash-out on behalf of the customer.

In STK Push, the merchant captures customer’s details and initiate transaction on their behalf. The M-Pesa registered customer gets a  pop-up notification to confirm the initiated transaction after which the transaction request is processed accordingly. Both the customer and merchant gets transaction confirmation messages.

This new M-Pesa API supports both REST+JSON and SOAP web service clients. Take your pick!
